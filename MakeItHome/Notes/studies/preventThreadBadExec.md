SignalRecovery is primarily a C library, but it can be used within Swift projects on macOS. Here's how to get started and some important considerations:

**1. Integration with Swift**

* **Bridging Header:** Create a bridging header file if you don't have one already. This will allow you to expose the C functions from SignalRecovery to your Swift code.
* **Import Header:** In your bridging header, import the SignalRecovery header file:

```objective-c
#import "SignalRecovery.h" 
```

* **Access from Swift:** You can now access the SignalRecovery functions in your Swift code using their C function names (e.g., `signal_try`, `signal_catch`).

**2. Error Handling in Swift**

* **`signal_try` and `signal_catch`:**  Wrap the code you want to protect from crashes within the `signal_try` block. The `signal_catch` block is where your error handling code will go if an exception occurs.
* **Access Exception Information:** Inside the `signal_catch` block, you can retrieve information about the exception using the `signal_info()` function. This can help you diagnose the cause of the crash.

**Example Swift Code**

```swift
signal_try_catch_init() // Global initialization

signal_try("myLabel") {
    // Your Swift code that could potentially crash
    let array = [1, 2, 3]
    let outOfBoundsValue = array[5] // This would normally crash
} 
signal_catch("myLabel") {
    let exceptionInfo = signal_info()
    // Log the exception information or take other recovery actions
}
signal_end("myLabel")
```



**Important Considerations**

* **Masking Errors:**  Be cautious when using SignalRecovery. While it can help prevent crashes, it might hide underlying bugs in your code. Use it judiciously.
* **Resource Management:**  Stack unwinding, which happens during exception recovery, can lead to memory leaks or resource leaks if not handled carefully.
* **Performance Impact:**  SignalRecovery introduces some overhead. Use it sparingly in performance-critical code sections.
* **Alternative Approaches:**  Consider using Swift's native error handling mechanisms (e.g., `do-catch`, optionals) to address potential crashes.
* **Debug Thoroughly:** Even when using SignalRecovery, thoroughly debug your code to identify and fix the root causes of errors.
