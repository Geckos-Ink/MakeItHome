## Notes
This project deserve a better documentation, most of all seen the fact that soon I should publish a new update, at least to improve the user experience and to complete the widgets zone. 

I try to make a to do list as memorandum:

- Complete Calendar widget
- Add the possibility to create a widget with, by default, a web page.
- By consequence, improve the settings zone and add the possibility to manage singular widgets, show or hide other ones etc.
- Improve clipboard widget, it's aging badly: the grid often overlaps items. Remember to change the position of older items again copied.
- Try to improve the detection sensibility and fix the fact that, when the app is not used for long time, its first activation is glitching.
- Find a way to improve the performances.
- Find a way to have the community advise about the development of the feature.
- Find the new icon. And find a possible new name for the app.

By the way, I'm currently working on branch 1.9.4 to publish the next release.
