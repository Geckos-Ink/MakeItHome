## Notes
This project deserve a better documentation, most of all seen the fact that soon I should publish a new update, at least to improve the user experience and to complete the widgets zone. 

I try to make a to do list as memorandum:

- Find a way to improve the performances.
- Find a way to have the community advise about the development of the feature.
- Improve Notes and Tasks widgets. The most problem is about the saving way, that used to saves the entire database every time.
- Correct the calendar permission request. The user is able to edit it even if he refused the permission. The in-using crashes are problematic, mostly in case of "Show in Dock" disabled.

## Development guide
- The top widgets zone web assets if located at MakeItHome/Resources/assets/, instead the Swift controller is located at MakeItHome/Views/Overscreen/WidgetZoneView.swift
